# Pokemon-for-Humans
Utterly useless Pokemon Go clone that focuses on capturing humans instead of Pokemon. Brutal honesty.

Built as a clone of Pokemon Go solely as comic relief and gags for Dinster's Tech Vlogs YouTube channel

Note: It's kinda weird that you would want to clone this and improve it. It's a game where you catch humans. What does that make you?
